# CODECRAFT_GA_05
This project applies neural style transfer to blend the artistic style of one image (like a painting) with the content of another. Using a pre-trained VGG19 model in PyTorch, it generates a new image that retains the structure of the content while mimicking the visual style of the reference artwork.
